          Hi! My name is Tom and I'm a Software Engineer and Support Specialist
          at <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com">Crunchy Data</a>. I like fountain pens,
          mechanical keyboards, amateur radio, and making things.

        <div class="bio long">
          Heyo!<br/>My name is Tom and I'm a Software Engineer and Support
          Specialist at <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com">Crunchy
          Data</a>.<br/> Before now, I worked as a Building Technology
          Support Specialist at <a href="https://www.pennmanor.net/">Penn
          Manor School District</a> in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and before
          that, I graduated with a B.S. in Physics from The University of
          Scranton in 2011.<br/> In my spare time, I enjoy building mechanical
          keyboards, writing things down with fancy fountain pens, making
          homemade hot sauces, modifying hardware, playing around with
          amateur radio, and experimenting with Software Defined Radio.<br/>
          In terms of where I am on the internet (and off), you might have
          seen me involved with Lancaster-area Technology groups, such as
          <a href="https://techlancaster.com/">TechLancaster</a>, or giving
          one of many talks at <a href="http://cposc.org/">CPOSC</a>.
          I spend a lot of time working on tiny little projects,
          many of which are posted and available on my public
          <a href="https://github.com/tomswartz07/">GitHub
          page</a> and I sometimes rant about technology on <a
          href="http://twitter.com/tswartz07">Twitter</a>. I'm excited to be a
          part of the Lancaster area technology scene and I would love to hear
          from you.
